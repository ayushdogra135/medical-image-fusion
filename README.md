This repository contains an implementation of the article "A multi-modality paradigm for CT and MRI fusion with 
applications of quantum image processing" 

The file AY_Demo.m is the demo usage of the proposed algorithm. It contains a source code for the proposed fusion method, 
along with a pair of images for performing the experiment. The dataset used in this paper can be download 
from https://www.med.harvard.edu/aanlib/home.html.
